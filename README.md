# CoopHive

CoopHive is a two-sided marketplace for computational resources. It enables users to run computational workloads in a permissionless protocol, where anyone can get paid to connect
their compute nodes to the network and run jobs.


# Getting started

Welcome to the prerelease series of CoopHive.

## CoopHive Networks

CoopHive operates on a decentralized infrastructure across multiple EVM-compatible networks.

## Install Hive Client

Download the latest release of CoopHive for your platform. Both the amd64/x86_64 and arm64 variants of macOS and Linux
are supported. (If you are on Apple Silicon, you'll want arm64).

To check your version use `which hive`. It it's an old version, run `rm <path>` to remove that path, and then reinstall the newest version.

The commands below will automatically detect your OS and processor architecture and download the correct CoopHive build for your machine.

### On Command Line

[//]: # (1. Detect your operating system and set it as $OSNAME)

[//]: # (2. Detect your machine's architecture and set it as $OSARCH)

[//]: # (3. Download the latest production build)

[//]: # (4. Check the version)

[//]: # (5. Install `hive`)

#### Install only hive

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoopHive/hive/main/install.sh | sh -s -- hive
```

#### For Resource providers and mediators: Install hive + bacalhau

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoopHive/hive/main/install.sh | sh -s -- all
```

[//]: # (<details> )

[//]: # (<summary>Installation script for Linux and MacOS</summary>)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (OSARCH=$&#40;uname -m | awk '{if &#40;$0 ~ /arm64|aarch64/&#41; print "arm64"; else if &#40;$0 ~ /x86_64|amd64/&#41; print "amd64"; else print "unsupported_arch"}'&#41; && export OSARCH)

[//]: # (echo $OSARCH)

[//]: # (OSNAME=$&#40;uname -s | awk '{if &#40;$1 == "Darwin"&#41; print "darwin"; else if &#40;$1 == "Linux"&#41; print "linux"; else print "unsupported_os"}'&#41; && export OSNAME;)

[//]: # (echo $OSNAME)

[//]: # (version=v0.10.0)

[//]: # (curl -sSL -o hive https://github.com/CoopHive/hive/releases/download/$version/hive-$OSNAME-$OSARCH)

[//]: # (chmod +x hive)

[//]: # (./hive version)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (sudo mv hive /usr/local/bin/hive)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (</details>)

### Manual [GUI]

1. Go to https://github.com/CoopHive/hive/releases/latest
2. Download the binary for your system.

### With Go 1.21+

`go install github.com/CoopHive/hive@latest`

## Run a job

First, make sure your Web3 private key is in the environment.

```
export WEB3_PRIVATE_KEY=<your private key>
```

Alternatively, arrange for the key to be in your environment in a more secure way that doesn't get written to your shell history.

### Cows

Hello World, now with cows.

```
hive run cowsay:v0.1.1 -i Message="CoopHive"
```

```stdout
 __________
< CoopHive >
 ----------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

> You can now switch from the default network using `--network <network>`  
> For eg: `hive run cowsay:v0.1.1 -i Message="CoopHive" --network halcyon`

### SDXL

Stable diffusion:

```
hive run sdxl:v0.2.8 -i PromptEnv="PROMPT= a hive of bees"
```

```stdout
 ___  __    __  ____  _  _  __  _  _  ____
 / __)/  \  /  \(  _ \/ )( \(  )/ )( \(  __)
( (__(  O )(  O )) __/) __ ( )( \ \/ / ) _)

Not working?
Try `rm -rf /tmp/coophive/data/repos`. Uninstall hive path, and reinstall from the start.

## Run a node, earn HIVE

```
hive rp
```

Deploy seamlessly on linux by utilizing [these systemd configuration files](https://github.com/CoopHive/hive/tree/main/ops).

## Available modules

Check the github releases page for each module or just use the git hash as the tag.

## Write a module

A module is just a git repo, and module versions are just git tags.

In your repo, create a file called `module.coophive`. For an example, see [cowsay](https://github.com/CoopHive/coophive-module-cowsay).

This is a json template with Go text/template style `{{.Message}}` sections which will be replaced by CoopHive with json
encoded inputs to modules. You can also do fancy things with go templates like setting defaults, see cowsay for example.
While developing a module, you can use the git hash to test it.

Pass inputs as:

```
hive run github.com/username/repo:tag -i InputVar=value
```

Inputs are a map of strings to strings.

### Writing Advanced Modules

1. `subt`:
   The `subt` function allows for substitutions in your template.

This function is a workaround for the lack of direct substitution support in the module. It implements
the [printf](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#Template.Funcs) function under the hood, which allows you to format
strings with placeholders.

<details>
  <summary> 
    Usage   
  </summary>
    The `subt` function can be used in the same way as the `printf` function in Go. You pass in a format string, followed by values that correspond to the placeholders in the format string.
    ```
    const templateText = `
    {{ subt "Hello %s" .name }}
    `
    ```
